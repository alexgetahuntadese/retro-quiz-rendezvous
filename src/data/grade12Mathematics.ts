Wait, let me recalculate: 100 = 5[4 + 9d], so 20 = 4 + 9d, thus 9d = 16, so d = 16/9 ≈ 1.78. The closest answer is 1.8, but let me check: if d = 1.6, then S₁₀ = 5[4 + 9(1.6)] = 5[4 + 14.4] = 5(18.4) = 92. If d = 1.8, then S₁₀ = 5[4 + 9(1.8)] = 5[4 + 16.2] = 5(20.2) = 101.

      explanation: "Let a be the first term and r be the common ratio. S₃ = a(r³-1)/(r-1) = 21 and S₆ = a(r⁶-1)/(r-1) = 189. Dividing: (r⁶-1)/(r³-1) = 9. Since r⁶-1 = (r³-1)(r³+1), we get r³+1 = 9, so r³ = 8, thus r = 2. Then a(8-1)/(2-1) = 21, so 7a = 21, giving a = 3.",
